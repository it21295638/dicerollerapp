# Flutter Roll Dice App

This is a simple Flutter app where you can "roll" a dice and get a random dice image each time. It was created during my learning journey with Maximilian Schwarzmüller's Flutter & Dart course.

## Features
- Rolls a random dice with images changing on each click.
- Interactive button that triggers the dice roll.
- Custom gradient background for a modern look.
- Built using Flutter, focusing on both **Stateless** and **Stateful** widgets.

## Built With
- **Flutter**
- **Dart**
- **Widgets** (Image, Column, TextButton, etc.)
- **Stateful Widgets**

## How to Run

3. Install dependencies: flutter pub get 
 
4. Run the app on your emulator or physical device:


## How It Works
Every time you press the "Roll Dice" button, a random dice image is generated, simulating the dice roll. It’s a fun little app to practice working with Flutter widgets and basic state management!
